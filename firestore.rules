/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Planet Comparator
 * @description This ruleset provides open read access (get, list) for all data,
 * and disables all write access (create, update, delete).
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *   This ruleset provides open read access to all the planet data. Write access is completely disabled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *   The database consists of three top-level collections: `/planets/{planetId}`, `/missions/{missionId}`,
 *   and `/real_time_data/{planetId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - Public Read Access: All collections are publicly readable to allow for a seamless user experience.
 *   - Write Access Disabled: All write operations are denied to prevent unauthorized data modification.
