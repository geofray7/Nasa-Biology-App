# **App Name**: SpaceBio Knowledge Engine

## Core Features:

- Cosmic Research Galaxy: Visualize research papers in a 3D interactive graph, with clustering and holographic panels for details.
- DNA Cosmic Explorer: Animate a DNA helix to show space-induced mutations and provide interactive gene sequence alignment.
- Virtual Space Laboratory: Simulate microgravity experiments with real-time parameters, plant growth visualizations, and radiation effect modeling.
- Astronaut Health Dashboard: Provide AI-powered health risk assessments with real-time vital sign simulations and countermeasure recommendations, using an LLM as a reasoning tool.
- Multi-Planet Biology Comparator: Enable side-by-side comparisons of biological adaptations across Earth, Moon, and Mars.
- AI Research Co-Pilot: Implement a chat interface for semantic search and summarization of research papers.
- Real-Time Collaboration Hub: Facilitate multiple researchers annotating papers simultaneously using a shared virtual whiteboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Nebula purple (#6C3483), evoking the depth and mystery of space.
- Background color: Deep cosmos background (#0A0A0A), a dark color scheme suitable for space visualization.
- Accent color: Planet orange (#E67E22), providing a contrast for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), lending a techy, scientific feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), suitable for longer text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use space suit-inspired button designs for interactive elements.
- Employ a mobile-first, responsive design approach.
- Utilize 3D animations with floating elements and particle systems for cosmic transitions.
